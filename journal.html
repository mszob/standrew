<h1>A Theology of Worship</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>“In the beginning is relation.”  — Martin Buber, I and Thou</blockquote>

<p>
    I do not know if Buber, as a Jewish philosopher, intended for the above statement from I and Thou to be an interpretation of John 1:1. Perhaps his words could be understood as a paraphrase of Genesis 1:1 in the context of his work. For Buber, a person can either exist in relation with an object, an It, or a person can exist in a state of relationship with a being, a Thou. “When Thou, is spoken, the speaker has no thing for his object. For where there is a thing there is another thing. Every It is bounded by others; It exists only through being bounded by others. But when Thou is spoken, there is no thing. Thou, has no bounds.”
</p>
<p>
    There is a kind of ontological ineffability about relation that eludes analysis. Hence, we approach the topic of worship with reverence for the relation that God establishes with us therein. As we attempt to write a theology of worship, we receive God as the free and boundless being that he is, and not as an object. Yes, God has made himself known to us in specific ways as he comes to us through the means of grace. In these means, however, God is revealed not as a process or a product that is delivered, but as a being who miraculously meets us in space-time. In that space-time, the finite is capable of the infinite, and liturgical ritual retains a mystical quality — in fact it assists the mystical relation itself. The goal of this paper, then, is to explore how a free and infinite Spirit comes to us, moment-by-moment, and not to limit that Spirit to rational categories and processes. We recognize the danger of transforming God into an object — dare I say into an idol! This would be most tragic and inappropriate when discussing our relation to him in worship.
</p>
<p>
    While the Thou of relation has no bounds, relationship is always dependence. An interesting angle to adopt in developing a theology of worship is to explore worship specifically as relational dependence on God. Viewed this way, the specifics of worship in Word and Sacrament are not crude limitations to our relationship with God, but the very shape that relationship takes as dependence. This paper will therefore explore worship as the very shape of the relationship with God that he initiates with us. After exploring worship in Scripture through this lens, we will turn to contemporary questions pertaining to worship in the Church of the Lutheran Brethren.
</p>

<h2>I. Worship as Relation</h2>

<p>In the Scriptures, the relationship between God and worshippers is often described as a covenant. In the context of the Old Testament, Robert E. Webber describes worship as being fundamentally rooted in a covenant and ratified by sacrifice. This can be seen perhaps most strikingly in the book of Exodus.
</p>

<h3>Worship initiated by God</h3>

<p>In Exodus 6, God reveals himself to the Israelite people in personal terms, making himself known by a personal name, Yahweh (Ex 6:1-8). In the following chapters, Yahweh communicates himself through specific means to a people he wishes to dwell among. After making himself known by his name, he brings them out of a land of slavery in an act of salvation (Ex 20:2). Then, Yahweh enters into covenant with Israel (Ex 19-24), making them his people and making him their God (Ex 6:7). The covenant is characterized by Yahweh’s provision of his Word (e.g. Ex 20:1-17), which the Israelites are to keep, and the ratification of the covenant with a sacrifice of peace (Ex. 24:5-8). Thus, though Yahweh himself initiates the relationship through a process not unlike evangelization, and although he gives Word and Sacrifice, there is participation from the people of God, who commit themselves to keeping his Word (Ex 19:8, 24:7), and who contribute to the building of the Tabernacle (Ex 25:1-9), where God will dwell among them (Ex 25:8). Diametrically opposed to this kind of worship-as-relation is the idolatry of Exodus 32, where the divine no longer appears as a Thou but is made to be an It, and where there is no longer any relation, but only self-service by means of an object.</p>
<p>The Israelites’ worship of the covenant God Yahweh is not an activity, but a mode of being with the personal divinity Yahweh, thanks to his Word, his Sacrifice, and his dwelling among them. Similarly, in the New Testament, God comes to humanity through the human person Jesus — the embodiment of personal Yahweh, the fullness of divinity in human form (Col 2:9). Jesus establishes a New Covenant with the people of God, ratifying it with his own blood, which he says is the blood of the covenant shed for the forgiveness of sins (Matt 26:28). This New Covenant is also based on Word and Sacrifice, the Word being called “good news” of God’s Kingly presence (Mark 1:15), and the sacrifice being the body and blood of Jesus (Heb 10:12). Jesus’ own body fulfills the Temple as the place where God dwells incarnate among people (John 2:19-21). Through a mystical union with Christ, God’s people are joined to Christ (John 15:5, 1 Cor 6:15, Gal 2:20), so that our bodies are now temples (1 Cor 6:19) and a house for God’s own Spirit (1 Cor 6:19, Eph 2:22).</p>
<p>Both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament, formal, corporate worship can be defined as an event when God gathers his people in order bestow his gifts of Word and Sacrament so that he can dwell in their midst. As the Psalms show so beautifully, worship then orients the people of God in a whole way of life that responds to God’s presence among them, so that suffering produces lament addressed to God, blessing produces doxology, and in all situations the psalmist expresses praise. This response on the part of the worshiper also includes proclamation. An interesting recurrent theme in the Psalms is the psalmist’s desire to tell of Yahweh’s great deeds (40:5; 78:4; 96:3; 105:2…), since Yahweh’s graciousness is the foremost cause of worship. Hence in Apology to the Augsburg Confessions, we read the following in Article XV, Of Human Traditions in the Church:</p>
<blockquote>For of all acts of worship that is the greatest, most holy, most necessary, and highest, which God has required as the highest in the First and the Second Commandment, namely, to preach the Word of God. Now, if this worship is omitted, how can there be knowledge of God, the doctrine of Christ, or the Gospel? But the chief service of God is to teach the Gospel.</blockquote>
<p>Trust in, sincere confession of, and proclamation of the Gospel is the human response to participation in God’s covenant; it is analogous to the Israelites words in Exodus 19:8, “All that the Lord has spoken we will do!”</p>
<p>In summary, we can both define worship as a dynamic relationship initiated by God through his means of grace, which are most visible in formal and corporate worship, and we can also describe it as the human lifestyle response to God’s gifts. A human response is sometimes implied in a definition of worship which centers on Word and Sacrament. Still, this should be highlighted as an essential part of covenantal relationship — by definition!</p>
<h3>Worship that engages the whole person</h3>

<p>Worship engages the whole person in self-giving out of response to God’s own self-giving in the means of covenant. We catch glimpses of this kind of worship that engages the whole person in the Old and New Testaments.</p>
<p>Some of the biblical vocabulary highlight the physical dimension of worship. Thus, the verb שָׁחָה, meaning “to bow down,” when used of a person bowing before a deity, indicates worship. When Yahweh appears to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre in Genesis 18:1, Abraham bows down to the earth before him in this physical sense. Similarly, in the Greek Septuagint and in the New Testament, the verb προσκυνέω has this physical quality. Other physical words for worship include עָבַד, which refers to any kind physical work of service, including ritual and religious service to deities. In accordance with the first commandment, the Israelites are not to “serve other gods” (Ex 23:24). While such ritual service is often associated with the Old Testament Mosaic law, Christians share in Christ’s sacrifice by presenting their own bodies as a sacrifice in ritual service (λατρεία, Rom 12:1). In today’s language, this ritual vocabulary probably best fits the way we use the word “worship” to refer to singing during a religious ceremony. Sometimes, the form and order of a religious ceremony as a whole is called “liturgy,” which comes from the Greek λειτουργέω. This word also refers to acts of service, and in Acts 13:2 it seems to include fasting.</p>
<p>Biblical verbs for worship do not only refer to physical acts. Instead, other words for worship speak of inner disposition. For example, the verb יָרֵא, which refers to fear, awe, or reverence, can be used to refer to a deep, worshipful reverence of God. It is with this word that Jonah introduces himself to his fellow sailors as a Hebrew who reveres Yahweh (Jon 1:9). The Greek verb εὐσεβέω is used in a similar sense in Acts 17:23. Finally, the verb יָדָה in the Hiphil, which is constantly used in the Psalms, refers to the sincere giving of thanks or praise (see Ps 6:5, 7:17, 9:1, 18:49, etc.). This word probably best fits our use of the word “praise” to refer to Praise Songs, which can resemble the Psalms.</p>
<p>Religious ritual, physical posture, and inner disposition all engage the worshipers’ body, soul, and even the environment around them in the act of worship. It is as if the worshipper has stepped into a new world, where everything becomes part of worship — including the realm of nature (see Pss 8, 19, 104). This is somewhat like how a person who is in love not only feels differently but also behaves differently and sees the entire world through rose-tinted lenses. </p>
<p>Other elements of worship signal this all-encompassing relationship. One is music. While Webber describes music as something that communicates God’s transcendence, music might not be as spiritual and mystical as we tend to think. Grounded in mathematical patterns that find their source in nature, music is also tied to the communities and cultures of people. Music also has a deep connection to the body — it is music and rhythm that provokes dance. The Psalms may suddenly seem less lofty to us when they mention dancing (Pss 30:11, 149:3), yet when paired with both dancing and with poetry, music has the incredible potential of marrying body and soul in all-encompassing worship.</p>
<p>We should conclude that it is not helpful to suggest that worship should primarily engage one aspect of our personhood and not other aspects. Sadly, such suggestions sometimes occur precisely among those who are attempting to respond to a perceived imbalance in worship. But reactionary responses try to correct one relational problem by creating another. To take one contemporary example, the goal of worship is not to correct music that lacks theological substance by attempting to limit God to a cognitive or “objective” sphere, as if the worship service were primarily meant to communicate some kind of factual truth. Instead, the goal is to be open to how Scripture reveals God engaging us in relationship with him.</p>
<p>This leads us to ask several practical and liturgical questions about living the theology of worship expressed above in contemporary congregations in the CLB. It is to these contemporary concerns that we will now turn.</p>

<h2>II. Contemporary Questions</h2>

<p>In a post-Messiah context where the ritual law and the Temple are fulfilled in Jesus Christ, there is a lack of universal practical guideline for worship within the Christian community. Questions like, “when should we worship” or “how should we worship?” are not answered in great detail in the New Testament. Instead, there is freedom flexibility in a religious life that finds its basis in participation in Christ and life by Jesus’ Spirit. Interestingly, as we have seen, Paul does use cultic language to speak of giving one’s body as a sacrifice. What this seems to indicate, however, is that cultic ritual is now turned over to the discernment of the body of Christ.</p>

<h3>What is from God and what is from humans?</h3>

<p>As in any relationship, freedom is never an abstract absolute in a vacuum when it comes to worship; dependence always exists as the basic mode of relation. In Christian worship, Word and Sacrament remain the places where God meets us in his grace. Hence Waddell insists that we hold to Augsburg Confessions’ distinction between the rites instituted by God — i.e., Word and Sacrament — and the liturgies developed by believers in their freedom, by the Spirit, and as a body. This distinction helps us to remember our fundamental dependence on the means of grace in worship, while conversely helping us to avoid taking human ceremonies too seriously and turning worship into a matter of processes and objects. While the word “liturgy” nowadays tends to refer to the entire order and form of corporate worship, Waddell helpfully points out that the 16th-century Lutheran use of the word more typically refers to the Word and Sacrament alone — that is, liturgy in the narrow sense.</p>
<p>How, then, should we develop our own liturgies and traditions? Of course, there is already a wealth of rich practices which have been established in many traditions throughout the world, and which address how, where, and when to worship. In the Western Hemisphere, one such tradition is the Roman Catholic liturgy, including the Roman Rite. One wonders if Lutheran necessarily need to change a liturgy that provides harmony and edification in the body of Christ if it does not inhibit or compromise our fundamental dependence on God in Word and Sacrament. To take the simplest of examples, the near universal practice of gathering for corporate worship on a Sunday is a valuable and helpful tradition both because it can incorporate Sabbath rest and also celebrates the day of resurrection. Use of the Church calendar is good for the unity of the body and the union of that body with Christ, as together Christians follow the life of Jesus throughout the year. Many such human traditions are adiaphora, meaning they are neither prescribed nor prohibited in Scripture. Their value comes from their ability to help us encounter God where Scripture promises that we do encounter him, namely, in the Word and Sacrament.</p>
<p>Even the CLB’s Low Church tradition, although it is a departure from Luther’s own liturgical practice, can be described as the result of a concern for properly directing worshipers toward the Word and Sacrament, and not as the result of an anti-liturgical stance. Former CLB President Robert Overgaard explains that our denomination’s Low Church tradition finds it necessary to avoid potentially confusing worshippers with the relative importance of Christ’s own rituals and human rituals, and to avoid alienating worshippers who may not have developed the cultural tastes necessary to appreciate High Church liturgy, among other things. I believe that such concerns are best understood not as absolute prescriptions about worship, but as having value in a given historical and cultural context for the edification of the local church. </p>
<p>Contextualization is always necessary because worship is a relationship. If worship were about abstract propositional truths, perhaps everyone could worship the same way. But if worship if God’s meeting with his people, then it is constantly dynamic. In the words of the CLB Mission Statement, “to share the gospel effectively, our churches must be both faithful to the Bible and relevant to the culture.”</p>
<p>We might summarize a healthy Lutheran approach to liturgy as the practice of distinguishing between liturgy in the narrow sense and liturgy in the broad sense in order to preserve the purity and simplicity of the means of grace and the theology of the cross inherent therein, avoiding reacting to an error by confessing the error’s opposite, but instead only avoiding that which compromises our full encounter with God in Word and Sacrament. Such an approach echoes Paul’s exhortation to the church in Corinth to organize worship in such a way as to be edifying for the body (1 Cor 14:26, 31, 44). </p>

<h3>Further Application</h3>

<p>Christian freedom in worship is used to serve God and serve our neighbor. Our neighbor may be the brother or sister in Christ who needs edifying, as in 1 Corinthians. It may also be the non-Christian visitor. It is valuable to consider if a given worship service can serve as an evangelistic invitation to those outside of the Church, or if it only addresses insiders. To neglect this missional quality of worship is to obscure the means of grace and obstruct personal contact between God and people. For this reason, the CLB Mission Statement affirms the following:</p>

<blockquote> One needs also to incorporate literature that gives more attention to the missional value of regular worship and discipleship through Word and Sacrament in our fellowship communities. Such an emphasis should include equipping and training for a proclamation of the gospel in word and deed that leads to ongoing conversion both inside and outside the church.</blockquote>

<p>The sending forth at the end of the worship service is a time when the missional quality of worship can be emphasized. While the beginning and the end of a service — the gathering and the sending forth — may seem unimportant compared to other elements of the liturgy, they are, after all, what allow worship to take place, just like the gathering at Mount Sinai and the sending forth at the Great Commission. In gathering, God comes to us as a missionary through Christ, and in the sending, we experience union with God through Christ, being sent as he was sent (John 20:21). In this way, we arrive at the four universal and truly Scriptural elements of the order of worship: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>1. God initiates relationship by gathering his people</li>
    <li>God establishes a covenantal relationship by his means of grace…</li>
    <ul>
        <li>2. …through the liturgy of the Word</li>
        <li>3. …through the liturgy of the Sacrament</li>
    </ul>
    <li>4. God sends us forth into the world to partake in His mission</li>
</ul>
<p>The same relational definition of worship that guides our order of worship can also help answer more specific questions. For example, many have questions about what music is appropriate for worship. I believe the most helpful goal to keep in mind in choosing appropriate music to use in worship is the ideal of worshipping with one’s whole person, meaning that a song which throws all the weight of worship behind an emotional experience with no theological grounding is probably just as unhelpful as a sermon which communicates biblical, “objective” truth without ministering to hearts.</p>
<p>What kind of space is appropriate for worship? An economic use of time and money is cited by Rev. Overgaard as a reason for Low Church worship; budgetary concerns have quite an impact on the kind of church building that is used by a given congregation. The position being advocated here is not an antagonism toward beautiful buildings, but an attention to stewardship. Even if a given congregation possesses ample funds, we should consider that Christ’s body is the Temple, and ask ourselves if it not better to use extra funds for deacon ministry, in other words, to tend to the temple of Christ body. And if community needs are met, what about outreach?</p>
<p>Another practical question is the following: who should lead worship? The answer to this question varies greatly from tradition to tradition, as there is very little in the New Testament about how exactly worship services were conducted, and by whom. In the figures of Titus and Timothy, we do see individuals dedicated to the service of the congregation in teaching and preaching with a certain authority (1 Tim 4:1-5, 13, Titus 3:14). Therefore, it is common for pastors to lead the liturgy of the Word and Sacrament. For the rest of the service, there is much value in resisting the professionalization of worship leadership in order for the body as a whole to be more engaged.</p>
<p>While the above are only a few tentative applications of a theology of worship, knowing how to worship becomes less of a quagmire when we know why we are worshipping. We have an easier time figuring out what to do once we have figured out who we are as those invited into relationship with a God of grace.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Local congregations are faced with many questions regarding the “what” of worship — what shall we sing? what shall we read? A theology of worship is meant to help backpedal and first address the “why” of worship. Worship is not a religious good to be sold to an audience, nor is it a series of motions which, when performed together, constitute a recipe for worship. Worship is first and foremost a state of being that engages the whole person in relationship with God within the context of his covenant of grace; worship is initiated by and received from God, as is clear in all of the Scriptures. Yet while worship is initiated by God and is a state of dependence on His means of grace, worship engages us on every level of our being, even transforming how we see the world around us.
</p>
<p>
    Old Testament ritual law and the Temple are fulfilled in Christ, meaning that those who are joined to the risen Christ have the liberty to discern how to contextualize our meetings with God in his Word and Sacrament. Practical questions regarding the worship calendar, order of worship, musical style, and so on should be addressed with the desire to avoid idolizing human inventions and objectifying worship; instead, the goal of liturgy in the broad sense is to contextualize liturgy in the narrow sense, — to contextualize the gathering of God’s people chosen people, their reception of the means of grace, and their sending out as missionaries. Finally, Christian freedom in worship is used for the edification and unity of the body and for outreach. In worship, God’s careful attention to how he comes to us is mirrored in our concern for the edification and conversion of others.
